                    <p>LOS ANGELES—Admitting that they were all just too embarrassed to come out and say it, sources
                        confirmed Wednesday that nobody in the entire Dodgers organization has the heart to tell
                        Shohei
                        Ohtani what’s going on with his interpreter. “It’s gotten to the point where we all just
                        kind of
                        look at each other and hope someone else will deal with it,” said manager Dave Roberts,
                        adding
                        that Ohtani has been showing up to games and press conferences with a man who is clearly not
                        his
                        interpreter but instead just someone he met on the street. “We know it’s not our place to
                        tell
                        him, but it’s getting more and more awkward every day. We’re all just hoping he figures it
                        out
                        on his own.</p>
